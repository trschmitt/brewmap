Tim O\u2019Leary, a third generation Montanan was living in Colorado, finding his way working for NOAA, mountain biking and skiing\u2026 and feeling a little bit like a fish out of water. Colorado is a beautiful state, but Montana was home. One afternoon on his bike ride home, he spotted a new business that had cropped up in Boulder. It was a Brew on Premise (BOP) \u2013 a place where customers could come in and brew their own beer. Having dabbled in homebrewing for a few years, he tried it and thought, \u201cThis is my ticket back home.\u201d\r\n\r\nFast forward to 1995. Tim and his wife, Suzy Rizza, open Missoula\u2019s first BOP. Lots of people came to try it, and lots of people had a great time doing it. It wasn\u2019t quite making the bills though, and for the next 13 years, through good times and worse times - Tim was the guiding force behind the transformation of the Kettlehouse into a small microbrewery and neighborhood taproom.",

      "description":
        "In 1996 an idea was born to start a brewery in west-central Montana with a name that reflected the region's rich agricultural tradition.  Thus, Harvest Moon Brewing set up operations in Belt, a rural community located 20 miles southeast of Great Falls.  Harvest Moon's first batches were available in late 1997.  Soon after, the brewery developed a reputation for a well-balanced, full-bodied beer that only quality ingredients in perfect amounts could produce.  The barley is grown and malted just a few miles from the brewery while the malted wheat and hops come from the Northwest. \r\n\r\nThe brewery uses modern, state-of-the-art brewing equipment but is still a \"hands-on\" system, which allows brewery owners Stan and John to ensure high production quality.  They oversee every step of the process, from malt handling to mashing, from wort transfer to yeast pitching, from fermentation to conditioning, and from packaging to shipping.  The fine attention to detail assures consistency of production and ultimately a great-tasting craft beer!Belt, Montana, is located 15 minutes southeast of Great Falls, and is home to about 700 fantastic Montanans. Harvest Moon Brewing Company calls Belt home and has named their wheat, Belgian-style ale, Beltian White, after the town.\r\n\r\nBelt is also strategically located above one of the purest sources of water. Wells tap into the Madison Formation where constant year-round temperature and quality allow Harvest Moon to use some of the most perfect water on Earth to brew beer.\r\n\r\nAnother great thing about Belt? They are located in the center of our great state, right in the middle of the grain-growers that supply our brewery with prime barley & wheat. Harvest Moon\u2019s ties to the farming community don\u2019t end there\u2026after we use the grains, we supply the spent mash to a local pig farmer to feed his hogs. Hence the name, Pigs Ass Porter. Delicious by itself and, surprisingly, with barbecued ribs!",

        "Dr.Mark Zilkoski, family doc in Wolf Point, Montana and Mark Sansaver have been drinking beers for years together. Originating their taste for quality on the front porch of Doc'Z homestead, the two micro-brewer sippers were often accompanied by fellow river bottom hoodlums such as Jeff Presser, Jeff Neubauer, Marvin Presser and of course the Z Matriarch-Mrs. Myrle (Mark) Zilkoski. And that is where it all began, on the Breaks of the Mighty Missouri-just a stone's throw from the steps of the Z Manor on the Big Muddy. The barley and the wheat grains are all American grown, harvested & malted:\r\nSome of the brews are then roasted to the perfect temperature to produce the\r\nprecise amount of color and flavor.",

        "Glacier National Park, Flathead Lake, Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex, snowcapped peaks, miles of hiking trails, raging whitewater rivers, deep fresh powder: Kalispell Brewing Company is proud to call the Flathead Valley home.  When we aren\u2019t out exploring new trails or skiing fresh powder, we\u2019re proudly brewing handcrafted lagers and ales in Montana\u2019s Glacier country.  And after a full day of adventure who doesn\u2019t want a Montana-made beer?\r\n\r\nKalispell Brewing Company has a 10 barrel brewhouse with an additional third vessel which allows us to do decoction mashes. Decoction mashing is an old process which harkens back to continental Europe that allowed brewers to extract sugars from under-modified malts more effectively.  It is no longer necessary to efficiently extract the sugars but with our malt forward lagers, decoction mashing produces a melanoidin-laden wort, which our yeast turns into in a truly complex and well-balanced Montana-made beer.  Sure, we could try to compensate with specialty grains, but it just wouldn't taste the same. With our lager beers, we\u2019re after superior taste. Decoction mashes may take more time and be more labor intensive but we believe, like all good things, it\u2019s worth the wait.",

        "Although the exterior of the building is pretty unassuming, the interior is welcoming and comfortable. There are two separate areas inside. In one area, patrons can sit in close proximity to the brew kettle and other apparatus, which creates a unique atmosphere and provides a good conversation starter. The other area is enhanced by natural light and a seating area for a small circle of friends. Scattered around the establishment are clever automotive references in the form of art, d\u00e9cor, and menu items. Overall the setting is open and easy to navigate, yet intimate.\r\nAs for the product, I'm no zymologist, but I'll try to do the microbrews justice. I chose to review the Black Nail Stout and the Radiator Dip Pale Ale \u2013 partly because they are so different.\r\nAlthough I enjoyed the flavor of the stout, it wasn't my favorite. My initial impression was bitterness and it was difficult for me to get beyond that and actually taste the beer. A second sample of the brew allowed me to recognize the rich flavor and the hint of coffee flavoring.\r\n\r\nThe pale ale I sampled was significantly lighter \u2013 in color and flavor. Although the IBU of the pale ale is higher than the stout, the body of the beer was smoother and had less bite. Beginner microbrew enthusiasts may enjoy testing the lighter brews first.",

We began brainstorming how to combine our love of beer and our family farms in Montana on a trip to Ireland and Italy in 2012. \r\n\r\nOur hope is that we make tasty beer that brings people together. We also hope that our work keeps us close to our family by growing barley at Adam's family farm in North Central Montana, growing our own hops, yeast and spices and brewing in Lauren's family's town in Western Montana. We believe that everything that goes in to our beer can be meaningful and improve the experience of drinking it.\r\n\r\nWe bought our half barrel system and worked more on recipes and licensing in 2013. We began construction at Lauren's family's farm in Spring 2014 and sold our first keg in October 2014.",

        "Beehive Basin Brewery is a new microbrewery located in the Town Center of Big Sky MT, right next to Roxy\u2019s Market. We operate a 7 barrel brewing system that has been created specifically for us by our friends at Portland Kettle Works in Portland, Oregon. We also run a small tap room where we invite you to come and taste some of our hand crafted brews. At this time we do not have any food service, but you are welcome to order in from one of Big Sky\u2019s many restaurants. We also on occasion will have a food truck parked in front of our tap room. \r\n\r\nOur small brewing system allows our brewmaster Andy Liedberg to constantly change up the beers we have on tap. Andy has been refining his skill at several different breweries across the country for over a decade. We are excited to finally let Andy realize his dream and start brewing the recipes he has been designing over the years. \r\n\r\nStop by the brewery after a day of fun in Big Sky and grab a pint or fill up a growler. Enjoy the mountain views from our tasting room or watch the brewmaster at work through our brewery viewing window. Hope to see you soon. \r\n\r\nCheers. \r\n\r\n\r\n245 Towncenter Ave\r\nBig Sky, MT 59716\r\nUnited States\r\n\r\nMon - Sun 12PM - 8pm(Growlers filled till 9pm)\r\nPhone (406) 995 7444\r\nEmail casey.folley@beehivebasinbrewery.com",

        "Opening scheduled for January 2016.\r\n\r\nBeing born and raised in White Sulphur Springs, owner Barry Hedrich had a great appreciation for the hardworking, rural lifestyle known to many in the area. With its high elevation and cool evening temperatures,the area is known for its high quality wheat and malting barley. After their children left home, Barry and his wife Chris decided it was a good time to start a new hobby \u2013 brewing beer. After a couple of years of testing, (much) tasting, experimenting with doing our own malting and researching the industry, we decided it was time to take the next step and open a brewery.\r\n\r\nThe name 2 Basset Brewery was born out of the many similarities between basset hounds and our love of a good beer. Bassets are friendly, easy going, very social and they love to relax. Most of all, they make us laugh. These are some of the very same reasons many of us gather with family and friends over a great tasting craft beer.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be crafting brews featuring locally grown grains, malting them ourselves and utilizing other Montana ingredients. Owners Barry and Chris Hedrich and their basset hounds Stanley and Leroy look forward to seeing you in beautiful White Sulphur Springs.",

        "With necessity being the mother of invention\u2026Bozeman Brewing was born.\r\n\r\nLet us explain\u2026\r\n\r\nWhen Todd Scott met his future wife Lisa Danzl while both were working and playing in Yellowstone National Park in 1986, they conceived a dream together: To one day live off the land. It was a dream inspired by a trip to Alaska and a love for the outdoors, and one day, darn it, they were going to make it happen.\r\n\r\nThe couple moved to Tahoe, where Todd put his culinary degree to work as a sous chef while they skied. It was here that they decided it was time to become self-sufficient. Todd had every intention of making their own soap, toothpaste, even toilet paper. But one thing haunted him\u2026 he didn\u2019t want to live without beer. He had no choice; the first step was to learn how to make his own. And that was also the last step.\r\n\r\nTodd\u2019s natural knack for home brewing, made with borrowed equipment, quickly trumped the couple\u2019s off-the-grid dreams. And let\u2019s just say that Lisa wasn\u2019t all that disappointed\u2026now she didn\u2019t have to use the homemade toilet paper for starters, but she also got to drink some damn good beer. Todd and Lisa had never tasted such fine brew, and they knew they were on to something special.\r\n\r\nThat was just the beginning of the journey towards Bozone beer. The rest goes something like this\u2026\r\n\r\nTodd refined his beer making skills for a brewery in Calistoga, while working another job and taking classes on the art and science of beer fermentation at UC Davis. But all the while, Montana beckoned.\r\n\r\nTodd scored a job as the head brewer for Spanish Peaks in Bozeman\u2015a position he held for 10 years\u2015and Lisa worked for the City. When Spanish Peaks moved production to California, Todd and Lisa knew it was time to bring their own fine brews to the beer drinkers of Bozeman. They bought the equipment and opened the doors to the Bozeman Brewing Company warehouse in 2001, on the edge of Bozeman\u2019s historic Brewery District on the north side.\r\n\r\nThere, Bozeman Brewing\u2019s flagship beer, Bozone Select Amber Ale (based on a recipe that Todd had perfected over the years), made its way to the beer drinkers of Montana and beyond. Today, the same warehouse rotates more than 4 seasonal ales and lagers, along with the regulars Hopzone IPA, Plum Street Porter and Bozone Hefeweizen, all on tap in the Bozone tasting room.\r\n\r\nAnd today, Bozone beers have truly become a Montana state of mind\u2026",
